<div id="data-entry-page" class="section level2">
<h2>Data Entry Page</h2>
<p>Field coordinators (FC) will input data from field and lab sheets one site at a time starting with the Sample Event Info panel, working down the page to Physical Parameters, Depth Parameters, Chemical Parameters, and finally Other Sample Information.</p>
<ul>
<li>For each sample event the only required fields are: Location, Sampler(s), Date and Time</li>
<li>The Lab Record # field is optional and it is only used so that records may be sorted in the order that they were analyzed in the lab to make it easier to review.</li>
<li>For inputs where ‘Other’ is the selected option a mandatory comment box appears and a comment must be provided to explain what ‘Other’ is.</li>
<li><p>If a parameter value was not provided on the field/lab sheets then ‘Not Recorded’ should be selected for multiple choice parameters and numerical parameters should be left blank.</p></li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong> may be added by clicking the <strong>‘Add Comment’</strong> button within each data entry panel, but only after the required fields are provided in the Sample Event Info panel.
<ul>
<li>Comments may be attributed to individual parameters or as a general comment attributed to the sampling event.</li>
<li>There is no limit to the number of comments that can be added.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Once all sample event data, associate lab data and comments have been entered for a sampling event the FC will click the <strong>‘Enter Record’</strong> button.</p>
<ul>
<li>A confirmation message will appear and a prompt will allow you to refresh the Data Entry Page to add the next record.</li>
<li>Entered records are stored two staging files:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>~/LocalProjectDir/StagedDataStaged/BRC_StagedData.csv</li>
<li>~/LocalProjectDir/StagedDataStaged/BRC_StagedComments.csv</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>Enter all records for the month over one or multiple sessions and then proceed to the ‘Staged Data’ page where all staged data can be reviewed and submitted.</p>
</div>
<div id="staged-data-page" class="section level2">
<h2>Staged Data Page</h2>
<p>The staged Data page has three tabs - ‘Staged Data’, ‘Staged Comments’, and ‘Process &amp; Submit’. Staged records are split between data and comments because of the one-to-many relationship between data and comments. The entered data and comments can be searched, sorted, reviewed, and edited.</p>
<p>Editing options include deleting entire records, modifying the entries, or adding additional comments. If a record for a sample event is deleted and it has associated comments, those comments will not be imported to the database. After edits are made to staged data the ‘Save’ button must be clicked in order to propagate those changes to the staged csv files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review all records in the staged data and staged comments tables</li>
<li>A single record can be viewed in ‘long’ format by clicking on a row in the table</li>
<li>You can delete a record by selecting a row and clicking “Delete”</li>
<li>Use the Data Entry page to add new records or to re-enter a deleted record</li>
<li>Edit the entered data by clicking the ‘Edit’ button.
<ul>
<li>Toggle through records by clicking the arrows at the top of the edit pop-up</li>
<li>Click the ‘Update’ button to confirm edits, or press ‘Cancel’ to drop edits.</li>
<li>After editing and deleting records you must click ‘Save’ in order to permanently save your changes</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>After all records have been reviewed proceed to the ‘Process &amp; Submit’ tab to process and submit the staged data/comments to the PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the ‘Process’ button.
<ul>
<li>This will check for input errors and data integrity</li>
<li>The processed data is displayed in two tables below</li>
<li>You will see placeholder values for empty results (-999999 for numerical data and ‘Not Recorded’ for text data)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If no problems are found at this step the data can then be submitted using the ‘Submit’ button. When the submit button is pressed the following events are triggered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The staged data and staged comment files are renamed using the FC zone and the current date.</li>
<li>The renamed files are uploaded to the staged submitted folder on Dropbox.</li>
<li>The renamed files are archived to this folder:
<ul>
<li>~/LocalProjectDir/SubmittedData</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An email confirmation/notification is sent to the FC submitting the data and the Program Coordinator.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="submitted-data-page" class="section level2">
<h2>Submitted Data Page</h2>
<p>After data has been submitted it can be accessed on the Submitted Data Page. A drop-down menu at the top of the page allows the user to select which submitted data to view. Field Coordinators will be able to see all files that they have previously submitted. The PC will only see submitted data that has yet to be imported to the database. There is no further functionality for the FC on this page – submitted data can be viewed and that is all. This page is the start of the workflow for the PC.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="program-coordinator-workflow" class="section level1">
<h1>Program Coordinator Workflow</h1>
<p>The PC will review and import one submission at a time (consisting of one data and one comment file). The PC review and import process is similar to the FC review and submit process. Records may be deleted or edited and new comments may be added.</p>
<ul>
<li>Review submitted records (modify records where necessary)</li>
<li>Note: Any changes to submitted data will not be reflected in FC copies of submitted data. This includes any added comments</li>
<li>When QA/QC is complete the PC will process the records by clicking the Process button.
<ul>
<li>Data will be checked for errors and integrity and it will be presented below for preview prior to import in the database.</li>
<li>This process step converts the data from flat files to the the related table formats where the data will be stored in the database.</li>
<li>Data is split into two tables- one for numerical parameter values and one for text parameter values. Comments will remain in their own table.</li>
<li>The forth table is a transaction log for each sample event with metadata for each event consisting of the import date and the name of the PC who imported the data.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>If any errors were found during processing the PC can go back and fix the submitted results. If no errors are found then an <strong>Import button</strong> will appear and the PC may import the data to the database. When the ‘Import’ button is clicked the following events are triggered:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 4 data tables are imported into the database</li>
<li>The submitted files are moved to the archived data folder on Dropbox</li>
<li>The submitted files are moved to the local data archive folder on the PC’s computer:
<ul>
<li>~/LocalProjectDir/Imported_Data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The updated data in the database is re-queried and RDS files are uploaded to Dropbox<br />
</li>
<li>An email confirmation/notification is sent to the PC and all FC’s letting everyone know that new data has been added to the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time the app is opened all users will be able to see the database tables on the Database page (Under the ‘More’ dropdown menu on the navigation bar)</p>
